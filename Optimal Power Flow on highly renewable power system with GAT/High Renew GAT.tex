\section{Abstract}
Integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, poses
challenges due to their inherent variability. Frequent recalibrations of power
settings are necessary due to changing weather conditions, which makes
recurrent OPF resolutions necessary. State-of-the-art, physics-informed
machinel earning methodology trained on imitation learning and historical
european datasets. This approach correlated electricity demand and weather
patterns with power dispatch and generation.
